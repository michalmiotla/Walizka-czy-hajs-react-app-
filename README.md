## About app

'Walizka czy hajs' is a reference to famous TV show, known worldwide as "Deal or no Deal", or "Grasz czy nie grasz?" in polish version. This application demonstrates nearly the same game rules as mentioned before broadcasted programmes. 

## How it works?

As a player, you need to win as much money, as you can, choosing wisely every next step. This game has a large element of randomness, so achieving the main goal (1.000.000 zlotych) is hard to execute in first few attempts. Thanks to that, game has a "repeat value" and we can try over and over again to beat our best performance. Players have two ways to win - accepting bank offers for case buyout, which is adapted to game progress, or waiting with original choice to endgame. 

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite
- JavaScript
- Module CSS
- Figma
- AI image generators

## What I learned?

That was the most complicated project in my learning road so far. I have used React only for small apps, created just for myself, like ToDoList or Quiz, here I needed to introduce much more logic and connections between many components and game stages. I have also used Figma for the first time, learning before only basics, but it helped me very much and I arranged app style without problems that I had before, when I realised projects with no preview. 

## How to improve app?

- Adding table with best prizes won by player saved in local storage.
- Adding more animations and transitions within panels to breathe more "life" into this app
